## Corporate Aftershock
##### The Public Policy Lessons from the collapse of enron and other major corporations 

-----
This paper looks at how Enron and how it helped shape public policy for its business doings. 

Enron used business strategy called asset lite which looks to make money of synergies of small physical market presence, market making function on derivatives, and a basis trading operation. While this did not require Enron to have a lot of capital expenditure and investment in fixed capital it did require them to have a lot of equity capital to show that they were creditworthy enough to do business with. Trying to accomplishing this is where Enron got into trouble. 

The paper looks at the difference between a neoclassical view and the neo-austrian view. To identify and analyze must be done through trial and error. This does not sit well with neoclassical economists because they want to have a measure for everything they observe. With the neo-Austrian view we have the ability to think about the markets as a flow that is always pushing towards equilibrium creating an arbitrage opportunity.The reason that neoclassical economists are uneasy with the notion is because it does not have a set of assumptions and is untestable. 

In short Enron perceived an informational advantaged that they pursued and were wrong. it is worthy of noting that Enron was willing to try and this in part is what drives economic innovation.
