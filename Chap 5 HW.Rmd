5.1

 Description  |  Payment  |  Change Ownership  |  Payment Amount
 ------------ | --------- | ------------------ | ---------------
 Outright Sale | 0		 | 0				    | $S_0$ at time 0
 Loan Sale & Security Sale| T | 0| $S_0$$e^{rT}$ at time T
  Prepaid Forward | 0 | T | ?
  Forward | T | T | ? x $e^{rT}$
  
5.2 

a) The Equation we use for this problem is:
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = S_{0} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{r(T-t_i)}D_{ti} 
$$
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = 50 - .985 - .970 - .956 - .942 = 46.147
$$
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = $46.147
$$

b) Take the prepaid price and find the future value using a 6% interest rate 

$$
F_{0,T} = F_{0,T}^{P}e^{rT}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 46.147e^{.06 x 1}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = $49.00
$$

5.3

a) The equation to use is:
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = S_{0}e^{-rT}
$$
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = 50e^{-.08 x 1}
$$
$$
F_{0,T}^{P} = 46.1558
$$

b) Same thing as 5.1b:

$$
F_{0,T} = F_{0,T}^{P}e^{rT}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 46.1558e^{.06 x 1}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 49.01
$$

5.4

a) 
$$
F_{0,T} = S_{0}e^{rT} 
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 35e^{.05 x .5}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 35.886
$$

b) The Equation for the forward premium is:
$$
\frac{ln\frac{F_{0,T}}{S_{0}}}{T}
$$
$$
\frac{1}{.5}ln\frac{35.50}{35} = .0284
$$

c) divident yeild is equal to the interest rate minus the forward premium 
$$
\delta = .05 - .0284 
$$
$$
\delta = .0216
$$

5.6

a) We would use the continuous divident equation 

$$
F_{0,T} = S_{0}e^{(r-\delta)T}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 1100e^{(.05-.015).75}
$$
$$
F_{0,T} = 1129.26
$$

b) Sell the short position on the index and lend that money out. 

c) borrow the money to buy the short position on the index. 

5.7 

a) using our pricing formula we get a market price of the forward to be 1127.85 so we would short the forward since it is over valued. We would make $7.15

b) We would go long on the forward since it is under valued. We would make $12.85 

5.8

a) We price the forward at 1116.62. Since the market price is over valued we should short the forward. we would make 3.38

b) if the market price is 1110 and our no arbitrage forward price is 1116.62. since the market price is undervalued we should go long on the forward. we would make 6.62

5.9

a) You could invest money in 1981 and then travel to 1982 and get the money 

b) If many people had this option it would push interest rates down 

c) It will not be possible as we just showed 

5.11 

a) 4 x 250 x 1200 = $1,200,000

b) 1200000 x .1 = $120,000

5.15 

a) 

$$
800e^{.055} = 845.23
$$

$$
800e^{.05} = 841.02
$$

b)

$$ 
(800 + 1)e^{.055} = 846.29
$$

$$
(800 - 1)e^{.05} = 839.97
$$

c) 

$$
(800 + 3.4)e^{.055} = 848.82
$$

$$
(800 - 3.4)e^{.05} = 837.44
$$

d)

$$
(800 + 3.4)e^{.055} + 2.4 = 851.22
$$

$$
(800 - 3.4)e^{.05} - 2.4 = 835.04
$$

e)

$$
(800 x 1.003 + 800 x .003 + 1)e^{.055} = 851.36
$$

$$
(800 x .997 - 800 x .003 - 1)e^{.05} = 834.92
$$

5.16

a)

$$
875e^{.0475} = 917.57
$$

b)

- Each future has a value of 218,750 (250 x 875).

- To cover our 800,00 exposure we would need 3.65714 (800,000/218,750) future
contracts

- We must then adjust for beta of 1.1. We would need 4.023 (3.65714 x 1.1) futures to hedge against our 800,000 portfolio. 

- We would earn the risk free rate over the next year.
