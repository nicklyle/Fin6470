##A Drunk and Her Dog

This paper goes into detail to understand the link between cointegration and the error correction model using a story about a drunk women and her dog. 

One key trait of random walks that the paper talks about is that the most recent observation is the best indicator for a future value. 

a second key trait is that the longer we go without observing where our value is, we can assume that, the farther away from that value it will be. 

While a random walk must be non stationary the distance between the two variable (the drunk and her dog) may be stationary.
